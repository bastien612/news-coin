# News-coins

News ecosystem aim at a total freedom of information. No censorship will be possible since information will be store in a decentralized way.

Journalist will submit their articles and will earn news-coins when people "like" their article.
Readers will need to buy news coins to be able to read articles and will be able to give little remuneration in liking articles.

This way, the news blockchain system will allow to skip traditional intermediaries between journalists and readers.
So, it is automatically be cheaper than traditional newspaper.

Moreover, no censorship will be possible, as articles are backed up in a decentralized way.

To avoid irrelevant articles to flood the system, journalist will earn trust the more their articles are liked.

News coins is the money that is used this system.
Right now, it is an ERC20 contract which use the ethereum blockchain.

We are currently developing the technology to make the new news system working.

It is currently an R&D project, but will soon be functional. For more information, you can read our road map.

This file will be updated as more ad more functionalities are added.
